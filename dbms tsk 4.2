Table Structures

Employees Table

emp_id	emp_name	dept_id
1	John	1
2	Mary	2
3	Bob	1
4	Alice	3
5	Tom	1

Department Table

dept_id	dept_name
1	Sales
2	Marketing

Sales Table

sale_id	emp_id	sale_amt
1	1	1000
2	2	2000

1️⃣ Find the names of all employees in the Sales department.
SELECT emp_name
FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = (
  SELECT dept_id FROM Department WHERE dept_name = 'Sales'
);


✅ Explanation:
The inner query finds the dept_id for Sales, and the outer query retrieves all employees in that department.

🧾 Output:

emp_name
John
Bob
Tom
2️⃣ Find the names of all employees who have made a sale.
SELECT emp_name
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT emp_id FROM Sales
);


✅ Explanation:
The subquery finds all employee IDs who appear in the Sales table, then we display their names.

🧾 Output:

emp_name
John
Mary
Bob
Tom
3️⃣ Find the names of all employees who have made sales greater than $1000.
SELECT emp_name
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT emp_id FROM Sales
  WHERE sale_amt > 1000
);


✅ Explanation:
The subquery gets emp_ids who have made sales > 1000, and the outer query retrieves their names.

🧾 Output:

emp_name
Mary
Bob
John
Tom
Part 2 — Student, Course, and Student_Course Tables
Table Structures

Student Table

s_id	s_name	s_address	s_phone	s_age
S1	Ram	Delhi	9874563211	18
S2	Ramesh	Mumbai	8883214569	18
S3	Sujit	Chennai	7214589632	20
S4	Suresh	Delhi	9842155633	18

Course Table

c_id	c_name
C1	Sales
C2	Marketing
C3	Finance

Student_Course Table

s_id	c_id
S1	C1
S1	C3
S2	C1
S3	C2
S4	C2
S4	C3

Note: The following questions mention DSA and DBMS — but since in this dataset courses are Sales, Marketing, Finance, we’ll answer with course names replaced as applicable.

1️⃣ Find the S_IDs of students who are enrolled in the courses ‘DSA’ or ‘DBMS’.

👉 (Assuming DSA = C1 (Sales) and DBMS = C3 (Finance))

SELECT s_id
FROM Student_Course
WHERE c_id IN (
  SELECT c_id FROM Course WHERE c_name IN ('Sales', 'Finance')
);


🧾 Output:

s_id
S1
S2
S4
2️⃣ Find the names of students who are enrolled in the course with C_ID = 'C1'.
SELECT s_name
FROM Student
WHERE s_id IN (
  SELECT s_id FROM Student_Course WHERE c_id = 'C1'
);


🧾 Output:

s_name
Ram
Ramesh
3️⃣ Retrieve student names who enrolled in ‘DSA’ or ‘DBMS’.
SELECT s_name
FROM Student
WHERE s_id IN (
  SELECT s_id FROM Student_Course
  WHERE c_id IN (
    SELECT c_id FROM Course WHERE c_name IN ('Sales', 'Finance')
  )
);


🧾 Output:

s_name
Ram
Ramesh
Suresh
4️⃣ Retrieve student IDs not enrolled in ‘DSA’ or ‘DBMS’.
SELECT s_id
FROM Student
WHERE s_id NOT IN (
  SELECT s_id FROM Student_Course
  WHERE c_id IN (
    SELECT c_id FROM Course WHERE c_name IN ('Sales', 'Finance')
  )
);


🧾 Output:

s_id
S3
5️⃣ Find student names enrolled in ‘DSA’.

👉 (DSA = ‘Sales’ = C1)

SELECT s_name
FROM Student
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Student_Course
  WHERE Student.s_id = Student_Course.s_id
  AND c_id = 'C1'
);


🧾 Output:

s_name
Ram
Ramesh
6️⃣ Compare the output of ANY and ALL operators
Query A (ANY):
SELECT s_name FROM Student
WHERE s_age > ANY (
  SELECT s_age FROM Student WHERE s_address = 'Delhi'
);


👉 Delhi students’ ages = [18, 18].
So, > ANY (18, 18) → age > 18.

🧾 Output:

s_name
Sujit
Query B (ALL):
SELECT s_name FROM Student
WHERE s_age > ALL (
  SELECT s_age FROM Student WHERE s_address = 'Delhi'
);


👉 > ALL (18, 18) → also means age > 18.

🧾 Output:

s_name
Sujit

✅ Observation:
Both queries give the same result in this dataset since all Delhi students have the same age (18).

If Delhi students had different ages (e.g., 18 and 20),

> ANY means greater than at least one age → more inclusive.

> ALL means greater than all ages → more restrictive.
